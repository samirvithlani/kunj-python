implicit type:
    int x = 12.22
    print("%d",x) -- 12
    float f = 12
    print("%f",) -- 12.0


explicit type:
    int x = int(12.22)

    broder type
    narrow type casting

    int x = int(float)

list:

list is dynamic:
list allows hetrogenius value..
list stires data in index
list is iterable
list is subscripltable
list allow duplicate values..
list is mutable


tuple is immutable..
tuple data type is tuple
() using we can create tuple

#find profit : [100,2200,30] -- >get profit % from user and after add give new list
#conver all name to upper and add into new list
#name starts with asked char and store to other list
#mixed list int string --> int[] -- string [] -->

key value dict: {}
{k:v}

all key must be unique:
value can be duplicate
dict is dynaimic
dict is iterable : loop
dict is subscripltable: key ---> value
